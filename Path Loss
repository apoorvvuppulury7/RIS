#Path Loss/Interference Model
Aim - 	a. Calculate Path Loss from one each BS to each user. Answer should be given in the form of a 2x2 path loss matrix.
        b. Calculate Interference from each BS to each user. Answer should be given in the form of a 2x2 interference matrix.
        c. Explain, or define, what is SNR and SINR (mathematically).
