# RIS
The main aim of this repository is to provide codes for the basic implementation of RIS and STAR-RIS Models. 
In these models, I am considering UMi Models, i.e. Urban Microcellular Environments, which encompasses any type of urban areas with dense infrastructure, such as street canyons and open squares. It accounts for the impact of tall buildings and other urban features on signal propagation.

All formulae regarding the UMi Model has been taken from the paper, TR 138 901 - V14.3.0 - 5G (can be accessed by the link - https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/138900_138999/138901/14.03.00_60/tr_138901v140300p.pdf).
